#Welcome to my MySQL Learning Documentation
ðŸ“š A Personal Journey in Learning MySQL

This documentation is a collection of my notes, insights, and experiences while learning MySQL,inspired by various resources,  including [MySQLTutorial.org](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/). 
It serves as a structured reference to help me (and potentially others) understand MySQL concepts, queries, and best practices.

##ðŸ”¹ What is MySQL?
MySQL is a popular **open-source** relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing and managing structured data. It is widely known for its speed, reliability, and scalability, making it a preferred choice for web applications, data analytics, and enterprise systems.
 MySQL follows the client-server architecture and uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for database operations.
